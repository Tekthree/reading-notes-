## Lists

- There are three types of Html list : ordered, unordered, and definition
- ![list](https://www.foxinfotech.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/html-lists.jpg)

- Definition lists are used to define terminology

- List can be nested inside another list

## Boxes

- Css treats each HTML element as if it has its own box surronding it.

- Css is used to control the dimensions of a box.

- You can hide elements using the display and visibility properties

- You can change a box from block to in-line and vise verse

## Basic Javascrip instructions

- An array is a special type of variable. It can store more than one value in a list.

- consider using an array when we are working with list of a set of values that are related to each other

- create a array and give it a name just like you would with any other variable. That is known as an array literal.

- Values in a array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list.

- The numbering of the list starts at zero

- To access a value from an array, after the array name you specify the index number for that value inside square brackets

## Decisions and Loops

- if ... else statements checks a condition.

- if it resolves to true the first code block is executed.

- If the condition resolves to false the second code block is run instead

-  In a switch statement, each case indicates a possible value for the variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value

- ![Falsy](https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*fYDCaOWdYvuzqBYl_r8XEQ.png)

- loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run

- A for loop uses a counter as a condition

- all values evaluate to either truthy or falsy
