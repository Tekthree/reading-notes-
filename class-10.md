## Error handeling and Debugging

- If you understand execution contexts  which have two stages and stacks, you are more likely to find the error in your code

- Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involes a process of deduction.

- The console helps to narrow down the area in which the error is located

- JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error

- USe try, catch, finally statements.

- Console.log is a great way to find out where issues may lay

- Commenting out all code except the code your looking at is a good way.

- Debugger(); or using break points.
