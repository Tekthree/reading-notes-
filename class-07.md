## Domain modeling

- Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.

- A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. 

- Object-oriented model is an entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods.

- when modeling a single entity thatll havre many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.

## Tables

-  the ```<table>``` element is used to add tables to a web page.

- A table is drawn out row by row. create rows with the ```<tr>''' element

- Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the ```<td>``` or ```<th>``` if it is a header

- Make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attribute

- For long tables you can split the table into a ```<thead> <tbody> <tfoot> ```

## Functions, Methods, and Objects

- creating an object: constructor notation : The new keyword and the object constructor create a blank object. 

- You can then add properties and methods to the object

- ``` var hotel = new Object(); ```

- to update the value of properties, use do notation or quare brackets.

- to delete a property, use the delete keyword.

- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together taht represent a single task

- Functions can take parameters(information required to do their job) and may return a value.

- An object is a series of barables and functions that represent something from the world around you

- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object, functions are known as methods of the object.

- Web browsers implement objects that represent both the bowser window and the document loaded inot the browser window.

- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality  that help you write scripts

- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets

- Both Arrays and objects can be contained in one another.
