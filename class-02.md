## Text

- Html has six levels of headings ``` <h1> through <h6>  ```

- ```<h1> ``` is used for main headings ``` <h2> ``` is used for subheadings

- ```<p> ``` is used for paragraphs

- ``` <b> ``` is used for bold

- ``` <i> ``` is used for italic

- ``` <sup> ``` is used for superscript and ``` <sub> ``` is used for subscript

- ``` <br /> ``` is used for line breaks and ``` <hr /> ``` is used to make a horizontal line

## Introducing CSS

- The key to understand how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.

- CSS allows you to create rules that control the way each box is presented

- Selector indicates which element the rule applies to

- Declarations indicate how the elements referred to by the selector should be styled

- Properties indicate the aspects of the element you want to change.

- Values specity the settings you want to use for the chosen properties.

- ``` <link> ``` element can be used to tell the HTML document where the CSS file is 

- ``` <style> ``` is used to insert CSS rules within the HTML document, normally it sits in the ``` <head> ```

- There are many types of CSS selectors, they help you target rules to one or more elements at a time.

- The last rule always takes precedence

- Some properties are inherited by child elements.

- USe an external style sheet so that you can reference that one style sheet on all HTML pages.

## Basic JavaScript Instructions

- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow.

- Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement

- Statements end with a ``` ; ```

- Make sure to write comments to explain what you code is doing

- /* */ for multiline comments // for single-line comments

- Variables are where a script stores temporary information it needs to do the job

- Data stored in variables can change each time a script is ran

- Where a variable is declared can have an effect upon whether the rest of the script can use it. That is referred to the scope of the variable. 

- String data type consist of letters and special characters and Boolean data type can have a one of two values , true or false

- Strings use a quote or a double quote ' Tek Jones'

- USe a backslash to tell the interpreter that the following character is part of the string

- Arrays are a special type of variable, it stores a list of values

- Values are assigned to arrays using the square bracket and seperated with comma

## Decisions and loops

- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.

- Comparison operators are used to compare two operands. ``` (===, !==, ==, !=, <, >, ,<=, =<) ```

- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators

- If else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false

- Switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes
