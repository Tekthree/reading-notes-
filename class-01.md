## Intro to HTML and JavaScript

***HTML*** pages are text documents

HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.

## HTML Structure of a Web Page

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>The Title of the Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>A Heading in the Body of the Page</h1>
      <p>Anything in the body is displayed in the main browser window</p>
    </body>
  </html>

```

- Tags are often referred to as elements

- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.

- Opening tags can carry attibutes, which tell us more about the content of that element.

## Extra Markup

- doctypes is a declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using

- to add a comment to HTML code use ``` <!-- --> ```

id attribute - every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.

``` <p id="pullquote"></p> ```

class attribute - every element can also carry a class attribute. a good way to identify several elements at once

``` <p class="pullquote"></p> ```

A block element will apear on the next line. some examples are ``` <p> <h1> <ul> <li> ```

Inline elements will always apear to continue on the same line. some examples are ``` <a> <b> <em> and <img> ```

Div element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box

``` <span> ``` is used to group and section of inline elements

``` <iframe> ``` is used to create a window of anoter page

escape characters are use to include special characters in your pages

## Process and Design

- It is very important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.

- A site map gives your a 1000 foot view of the structure to the website

- Wireframes are a way to organize all of the components and information that is going on each page

- Visual hierarchy helps vistors to easily understand what a website is about

- Color, size and style are a good way to organize information
