## Intro to HTML and JavaScript

***HTML*** pages are text documents

HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.

## HTML Structure of a Web Page

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>The Title of the Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>A Heading in the Body of the Page</h1>
      <p>Anything in the body is displayed in the main browser window</p>
    </body>
  </html>

```

- Tags are often referred to as elements

- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.

- Opening tags can carry attibutes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
